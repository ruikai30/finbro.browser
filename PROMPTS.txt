---- Always use this prompt before starting any conversation
----

Read this entire repository. Start by reading README.md
Most importantly, understand how this under repository is structured. Read the structure and then, fully internalise everything.
You may want to selectively deep-dive into some scripts to strengthen your understanding of this repo. But you don't have to overdo it - focus on breadth over depth as this is just the start
Once after this, I will let you know the specific task to do - and then we can deep-dive into a few folders/scripts that handles that particular task.

----
---- Use this template next - make it specific, measurable, optimized for context-engineering
----

Now, for the remaining of this entire conversation, let's focus on [XXX]

Let's keep the end goal in mind: we are trying to [XXX]

However, while keeping this end goal in mind, let's not rush into it first. You are still new to this repo, and let's only start to code once we have 100% confidence and an actionable plan.

Now, since you are still very new to this repo, and given the goal, I will need you to now deep-dive into these specific aspects of the repo [XXX]

Make sure you gain a full understanding of EVERY SINGLE ASPECT of this aspect - how the business logic works, how everything is connected, and also by extension - the potential reliance of scripts that could belong to other parts of the repo, but nevertheless it's good for you to know

Once done, I will give you the next set of specific instructions, and we can start drafting a plan

----
---- Write a custom prompt after the kick-off prompt and ask the AI to draft an implementation plan. If okay, send this next
----

Now, let's implement what you've suggested.

Word of caution before we start: let's follow best SWE practice. I want you to know EXACTLY what you are planning to edit before starting to write code and hence, I need you to read ALL THE SCRIPTS that you think are relevant.
We NEVER EVER want to be stuck in a situation where, you are reading new scripts IN THE MIDDLE of the code change operation, which is very very bad. Do it unless you absolutely have to (e.g. you realised that mid operation, something went off)

Following this practice, let's meticulously implement the solution you've proposed. Let's keep our code elegant.

ONCE CONFIDENT, START CODING RIGHT AWAY

----
---- Once everything looks up to standard (can take many small iterations), drop this
----

Everything seems fine now. But let's not let our gut down - we've literally made some fresh changes. Therefore:

Finally, before we end this phase, do a final check on EVERY SINGEL SCRIPT that you've touched throughout this conversation. Ask a few critical questions:
- Did you write code following best SWE principles?
- Are they future-proof?
- Any spaghetti code?
- Any imports not used?
- Any dead code/logs that you once used for debugging/intermediate purpose, but not used now?
- Did you try to take any shortcuts, and addressing symptom rather than root cause?
- Any comments that does not align with the content? Or intermediate comments that should be removed?

After reporting this, DO NOT SLACK OFF. Keep the entire context of this conversation, and get ready for next phase of implementation if all the checks are okay.
